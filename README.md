# Deep Learning with MNIST Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of TensorFlow to build and train a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The notebook showcases data preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and prediction stages.

## Project Structure

- `DeepLearningMnist.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the TensorFlow model and all the steps from data loading to predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Converts images to the appropriate format for model training.
- **Model Architecture**: Constructs a neural network using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- **Training**: Detailed training process with batch size and epochs clearly outlined.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the model on the test set to determine its accuracy.
- **Prediction**: Demonstrates how to make predictions with the trained model.

## Setup

To run this project, you will need an environment capable of running Jupyter notebooks with TensorFlow installed. Here's how to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   gh repo clone hruthik25/Mnistdataset
